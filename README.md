I want to focus a bit more on media queries. I am sure there is a lot more useful properities to discover


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp) - This helped me to understand media queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21369843/is-there-a-way-to-make-numbers-in-an-ordered-list-bold) - This is an amazing article which helped me to understand how to design <li> items. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
